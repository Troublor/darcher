# Badges to Apply for 

## Artifacts Available
This artifact contains the implementation of the tool proposed in the paper, *ĐArcher*, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in decentralized applications. 
The experiment results are also included in the artifacts. 
So we think it is eligible to apply for **Artifacts Available** badge. 

## Artifacts Evaluated - Functional

The artifact is:
- `documented`: We provide documents of instructions to install, and execute the tool, *ĐArcher* to detect bugs in the decentralized applications. 
- `consistent`: The artifact contains the implementation of the tool, *ĐArcher*, proposed in the paper to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in decentralized applications. Experiment results are also provided. It is consistent with the contributions mentioned in the paper.
- `complete`: The paper discuss the proposed on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs as well as the approaches to detect it. This artifact implements the proposed approaches, as well as the experiment results of the evaluation in the paper. Therefore, it is complete. 
- `executable`: Instructions and scripts are provided in this artifact to execute the tool, *ĐArcher*, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in decentralized applications, especially the subjects used in the evaluation.
